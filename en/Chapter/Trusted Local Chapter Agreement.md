# Agreement To Build A Trusted Local Fermat Chapter

I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,

will be responsible in the country of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ,

to run a _Fermat Local Chapter_ in the region \/ state \/ idiosyncrasy of  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ,

and I assure, that the responsibilities mentioned below, will be perceived by me and my fellow Fermatians.

These are:

1. Representing Fermat as a role model;

2. Supporting Fermat and its vision;

3. Building an ecosystem around the Chapter and supporting the Community and giving back.


I will set up a legal framework and connect Fermat to real life business \(building business on top of the IoP\) to optain three extra mining licences for the chapter and to be recognized as a _Trusted Fermat Local Chapter_ that is allowed to use the official Fermat symbols and trademarks on behalf of Fermat itself.

I guarantee, that I and my fellow Fermatians will

1. Build and maintain a website and use Social Media dedicated to the Local Chapter and Fermat

2. Setting up decentralized Full Stack Fermat Local Nodes in my region

3. Promoting Fermat and educating people about it, how to use it, why and the vision


I am aware, that obtaining the status as an official local chapter is a respectable burden full of duties and responsibilities, to help Fermat but also local economy in my area flourish, and therefore I may get a lot back from the Fermat community and from the Internet of People.

I will help other chapters and feel myself as being a part of the human family.

By agreeing to and applying these terms, my local chapter earns the right to be part of the Closed Beta Mining Phase mining the stakes for the IoP Tokens. On top, I gain the right to present me and my work under the umbrella of Fermat and gain the right to use it's branding and symbols.

Also, I gain ownership of a dedicated _local layer_ within the Fermat framework and network, that should help me building a real life business around my nodes and ecosystem.

This is not a contract with anybody, but my very own public written expression of engagement.

_Disclosure: I am aware that if I do not fulfill any of these rules and responsibilities, I may lose my right to mine or even be expelled from the official Fermat Local Chapters Network._
