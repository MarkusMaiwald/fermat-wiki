I've arranged some easy tips and tricks to make your facebook and twitter accounts more popular and to build a network of targeted followers. 

In the beginning, of course you won't have any followers so start out by adding the official chapter accounts as friends. Then you basically can let twitter and facebook do the work.

## Twitter
After a few minutes the list *Who to follow* will appear on the right of your start page. You should click on *Show all* to get a better overview. Now you go through the list and just follow everyone in your area of interest (crypto, iop, fermat, etc.). For every 10 persons you follow, at least 1 or 2 will follow you back. You can just repeat this pattern again and again. Give them time to follow you back, after a few weeks, when you are content with your followers, you can start unfollowing people that did not follow you back to gain a nice quota.
### Tip
1. Do not follow more than 50-80 pages a day!
2. You should *always* like and retweet **everything** from the official _**@fermat_org**_
3. You should also use the search tool and look for interesting people and pages by searching for terms like *crypto*, *fermat*, *blockchain*, etc.**

## Facebook
Exactly the same principle as for twitter, with one important difference. In the beginning you send a friend request to all fermat accounts and then **wait** for their approval. 
After that, you can click on _Friends_ >> _Find friends_ >> _People_ you might know* and again _Show all_. 
The list will get bigger and you will generate a large audience of people reading your posts. 
**Beware**: Facebook will also show you a lot of people you do not want to send a request to, because they have nothing to do with the Fermat network. Just take a look at the details and you will see if you and the person of interest have friends in common.
### Tip
1. You should also use the search tool and look for interesting people and pages by searching for terms like *crypto*, *fermat*, *blockchain*, etc.**
2. It is **important** to like all official Fermat posts on facebook.

## Other Social Media
The same Tips hold as well for the other social media types around, like Plus, Instagramm, Pinterest, etc.

_See how easy it is to spread the word about Fermat? :-D_


All the best!
