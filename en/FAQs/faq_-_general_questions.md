# FAQ - General Questions

Here are some general questions that people ask most.

## What is Fermat?

Fermat provides an unique framework for developers to build, mix, match, reuse and maintain interconnecting components for multiple apps. This enables developers to share app ownership and revenue streams – as well as saving time – in a way that has never been done before. Fermat’s app framework incentivizes collaborative, component-based design and shared ownership tracked and paid over the blockchain.

Fermat seeks to upgrade mobile operating systems, like Android, with a blockchain-enabled, collaborative framework for dynamic P2P-based commercial applications. Immediate parties to transactions themselves would enjoy more direct control and ownership of all of their data and digital purchasing power.

Fermat sits on top of a device’s OS, like an extension that supports an ecosystem of Fermat apps. This ecosystem is formed, like a complex organism from a network of cells, from a vast set of interconnected, reusable atomic components, with several of them being the user interface \(a Fermat app\). The project started on 2014 and is under development.

## Does Fermat have a Coin like Bitcoin?

Yes, Fermat has the IoP token. But it has not a PoW \(Proof of Work\) approach, but a PoS \(Proof of Stack\) approach.

The IoP token is worth 12$ \(Oct. 2016\) and is expected to rise, once trade on platforms is enabled.

Interesting about Fermat as a framework is that the use of multiple \(crypto-\)currencies will be enabled.

## How can I participate in the mining process?

There are just a few people who will be allowed to mine tokens.

_These are the following:_

* **Developers** who are or have been contributing to Fermat,
* **Local Chapters** and potential **candidates** to lead a Fermat Local Chapter, and
* other **big Contributers** to Fermat who showed their deep commitment \(by building a website, translating papers or else\).

If you are in either one of these groups, you will have the possibility to mine IoP tokens.

If you are not, the best possibility to mine is to build a Local Chapter. Local Chapters have

different tasks and responsibilities and are helping to spread Fermat’s Vision.

## How can I build a Local Chapter?

For a quick overview over the requirements, responsibilities and rules to become a trusted Fermat Local Chapter.

Generally speaking everybody can found a Local Chapter and support Fermat. But it is possible to attend in a supportive program by Fermat. In it you will be get help while you are building the chapter.
