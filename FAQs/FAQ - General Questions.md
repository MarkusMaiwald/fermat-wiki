# FAQ - General Questions

Here are some general questions that are asked a lot.

## How can I participate in the mining process?

There are just a few people who will be allowed to mine tokens.

_These are the following:_

* **Developers** who are or have been contributing to Fermat,
* **Local Chapters** and potential **candidates** to lead a Fermat Local Chapter, and
* other **big Contributers** to Fermat who showed their deep commitment \(by building a website, translating papers or else\).

If you are in either one of these groups, you will have the possibility to mine IoP tokens.

If you are not, the best possibility to mine is to build a Local Chapter. Local Chapters have

different tasks and responsibilities and are helping to spread Fermatâ€™s Vision.
