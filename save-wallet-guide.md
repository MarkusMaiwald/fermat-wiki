\# Safe Wallet Guide for countries with a high theft rate



Many people say that Crypto-Wallets are a very safe place to store your money in. But there are several circumstances in which you can lose your Wallet and therefore your money.



Imagine you only have a smartphone and no computer to store your money\\/IoPs on. Normally you take your smartphone everywhere you go. But if you live in a country with a high theft rate, the probability to lose your smartphone, and the wallet stored on it, is very high. There are several countries in which this is the case, these are for example Belgium, Venezuela, South Africa and many more.



So storing all your money\\/IoPs on your smartphone is very dangerous!



In the following guide we will describe a way to keep your money safe although you live in a country with a high crime rate in theft.



You will need:



\* Your currently used smartphone



\* A not usually used smartphone, with Android 4.1 and up



\* A USB-Stick



\* Optional: Access to a Cloud platform

Install the IoP Wallet on both of your Smartphones.



Your not used smartphone will now serve as a “digital safe”, in which you store most of your IoPs.



Your currently used smartphone will serve as an actual wallet. You will only store a certain amount of money on it. To be specific: The amount of money you will need to spend over the day.



The “digital safe” will now be hidden in a safe place. This could either be a hidden place in your flat or an actual safe, so if someone breaks into your flat, your digital safe will not be found.



If someone steals your currently used smartphone, only a very small amount of money will be lost. You will still have your “digital safe”.



\#\# Step 2 - Backup your “digital safe” wallet



Now your money is safe in case someone steals your smartphone.



But there is still the possibility that someone breaks into your apartment and steals your “digital safe”.



To be on the safe side, you will need to make an encrypted backup of your “digital safe” wallet.

You can store your backup either on a USB-Stick\\/SD-Card or in the Cloud. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.
