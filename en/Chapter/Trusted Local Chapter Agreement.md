# Agreement To Build A Trusted Local Fermat Chapter

I, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_,

responsible for the local chapter \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ,

in the region \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ,

assure, that the responsibilities mentioned below will be perceived by me and my fellow Fermatians.

These are:

1. Representing Fermat as a role model

2. Supporting Fermat and its vision

3. Building an ecosystem around the Chapter and supporting the Community


We will comply with the following rules:

1. Set up a legal framework and connect Fermat to real life business \(building business ontop of the IoP\)

2. Build and maintain a website dedicated to the Local Chapter

3. Setting up decentralized Full Stack Fermat Local Nodes in my region

4. Promoting Fermat and educating people about it


I am aware, that obtaining the status as an official local chapter is a respectable burden full of duties and responsibilities, to help fermat but also local economy in my area flourish, and therefore I may get a lot back from the Fermat community and from the Internet of People.

I will help other chapters and feel myself as being a part of the human family.

By agreeing to and applying these terms, my local chapter earns the right to be part of the Closed Beta Mining Phase mining the stakes for the IoP Tokens.

Also, I gain ownership of a dedicated _local layer_ within the Fermat framework and network, that should help me building a real life business around my nodes and ecosystem.

This is not a contract with anybody, but my very own public written expression of engagement.

_Disclosure: I am aware that if I do not fulfill any of these rules and responsibilities, I may lose my right to mine or even be expelled from the official Fermat Local Chapters Network._
