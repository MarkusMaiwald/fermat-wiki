Hi there!
You are going to learn how you can safely store your IoP Tokens or any other cryptocurrency on your smartphone although you live in a country with a high crime rate, especially theft.

If you have a wallet on your smartphone, for example the IoP mobile wallet, you can store your money on your smartphone and pay with it.
Normally you carry your phone with you all day long.
But what happens, if you get robbed and your phone with your money is stolen?
You will lose every penny that is stored on your wallet. And if it was a lot, you will be very angry.
But what can you do about it?
I am going to show you a little trick to savely store your tokens on your smartphone and make business with it.
You will need an old not used smartphone and your currently used smartphone.
Your old smartphone will serve as a safe, containing most of your money. Your currently used smartphone will serve as an actual wallet, with just a little money on it.
You should make an encrypted backup of your safe wallet and store it safely.
You can always transfer your money from your safe to your every-day wallet, and the other way around. You will only carry your small wallet with you.
Now you can do business with your smartphone and don’t need to fear that all your money is stolen, if you lose your phone.
